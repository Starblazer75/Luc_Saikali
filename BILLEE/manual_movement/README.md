## Manual Movement
This is the movement code that I created for the rover

This creates a node which posts controller inputs into a topic

Also creates a node which listens to that topic and moves motors accordingly

This was designed before considering autonomous movement, so it will be redesigned once Nav2 has been set up


Source code is in manual_movement
